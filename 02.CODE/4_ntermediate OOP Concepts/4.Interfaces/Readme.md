🎯 Topic 4 Complete: Interfaces and Interface Implementation
Key Concepts You Just Learned:
Interfaces define pure contracts - they specify WHAT classes must implement but not HOW. 
They're like job descriptions that define required capabilities.
Critical Interface Rules:

All members are implicitly public and abstract
Classes can implement multiple interfaces (unlike inheritance)
Interfaces cannot have constructors or fields
Interfaces can have default implementations (C# 8.0+)
Use interface keyword and conventionally start names with "I"

Key Implementation Techniques:

Implicit Implementation: Normal public methods
Explicit Implementation: void IInterface.Method() - only accessible through interface reference
Multiple Interfaces: One class can implement many interfaces
Interface Polymorphism: Use interface references to work with different implementations

When to Use Interfaces:

✅ Define capabilities (IFlyable, ISwimmable, IComparable)
✅ Multiple inheritance needed
✅ Loose coupling between classes
✅ Testability (mock interfaces easily)
✅ Plugin architectures

Best Practices:

Keep interfaces focused and cohesive (Single Responsibility)
Use descriptive names ending in -able when appropriate
Program to interfaces, not concrete implementations
Use explicit implementation to resolve naming conflicts

Real-world Power:
Interfaces enable dependency injection, plugin architectures, and loose coupling - essential for maintainable, testable code!
