🎯 Topic 5 Complete: Polymorphism
Key Concepts You Just Learned:
Polymorphism (Greek: "many forms") is the ability for objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same base type, 
while each object maintains its own specific behavior.
Types of Polymorphism in C#:

Compile-Time Polymorphism:

Method overloading (same name, different parameters)
Operator overloading


Runtime Polymorphism (True Polymorphism):

Method overriding with virtual/override
Abstract method implementation
Interface implementation



Key Mechanisms:

Virtual Methods: Base class defines behavior that can be overridden
Abstract Methods: Base class defines contract that must be implemented
Interface Implementation: Classes implement common contracts differently
Base Class References: Treat derived objects as base type

Runtime Type Operations:
csharp// Type checking
if (shape is Circle) { ... }

// Safe casting
Circle c = shape as Circle;
if (c != null) { ... }

// Pattern matching (C# 7.0+)
switch (shape) {
    case Circle c when c.Radius > 5:
        // Handle large circles
        break;
}
The Power of Polymorphism:

Code Reusability: Write once, works with all implementations
Extensibility: Add new types without changing existing code
Maintainability: Changes to implementations don't break client code
Design Patterns: Enables Strategy, Factory, Observer patterns

Best Practices:

Program to interfaces/abstractions, not concrete implementations
Use polymorphism to eliminate switch/if statements based on type
Leverage generic constraints for type-safe polymorphism
Prefer composition with interfaces over deep inheritance hierarchies

Real-World Benefits:

Plugin Architecture: Load different implementations at runtime
Testing: Mock interfaces for unit testing
Framework Design: Same API works with different implementations
Strategy Pattern: Change algorithms without changing client code
