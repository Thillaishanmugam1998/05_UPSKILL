🎯 Topic 2 Complete: Method Overriding (virtual, override)
Key Concepts You Just Learned:
Method Overriding allows derived classes to provide their own implementation of base class methods 
while maintaining the same method signature (name, parameters, return type).

Critical Keywords:

virtual in base class = "This method CAN be overridden"
override in derived class = "I'm providing my own version of this virtual method"
base.MethodName() = "Call the base class version of this method"

Important Rules:

Only virtual methods can be overridden
override keyword is REQUIRED (not optional)
Overridden methods must have identical signatures
You can call base class implementation using base.MethodName()

Three Overriding Patterns:

Complete Replacement: Don't call base.Method() - provide entirely new behavior
Extension: Call base.Method() then add more behavior
Conditional: Sometimes call base, sometimes don't (based on logic)

Best Practices:

Use virtual methods when you expect derived classes to customize behavior
Always use override keyword explicitly for clarity
Consider calling base.Method() when you want to extend rather than replace
Don't make methods virtual unless you have a good reason

Real-world Power:
This enables polymorphism - you can treat objects as their base type but they still behave according to their actual derived type!
