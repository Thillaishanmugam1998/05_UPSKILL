🎯 Topic 3 Complete: Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
Key Concepts You Just Learned:
Abstract Classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serve as blueprints for derived classes. 
They can contain both concrete (implemented) and abstract (unimplemented) methods.
Critical Rules:

abstract class = Cannot create instances with new
abstract method = Must be implemented in derived classes (no body in abstract class)
Abstract methods are implicitly virtual
Derived classes MUST implement ALL abstract methods
Abstract classes can have constructors, regular methods, and properties

Key Differences from Virtual Methods:
Virtual MethodsAbstract MethodsOptional to overrideMUST overrideHas implementation in baseNo implementation in baseCan be called directlyCannot be called (no body)Use virtual keywordUse abstract keyword
When to Use Abstract Classes:

Shared Code: When derived classes share common functionality
Enforced Contract: When you need to guarantee certain methods exist
Template Pattern: When you have a workflow that uses abstract methods
IS-A Relationship: When all derived classes are truly the same type

Best Practices:

Use abstract classes when you have common code to share
Keep abstract methods focused and well-defined
Use the Template Method pattern (concrete method calls abstract methods)
Provide meaningful base functionality in concrete methods

Real-world Power:
Abstract classes let you define a contract (what must be implemented) while providing shared functionality (what's already implemented). This is perfect for frameworks and APIs!
