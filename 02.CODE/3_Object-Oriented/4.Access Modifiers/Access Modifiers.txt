Access Modifiers
Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, fields, and other members in your code. 
They are fundamental to implementing encapsulation and maintaining proper code structure.
private: Members are accessible only within the same class. This is the default access level for class members and provides 
the highest level of encapsulation.
public: Members are accessible from anywhere in the program. 
Use this for members that need to be accessed by external code.
protected: Members are accessible within the same class and by derived classes (inheritance). 
This allows controlled access in inheritance hierarchies.
internal: Members are accessible within the same assembly (project). 
This is useful for creating APIs that are public within your project but not exposed to external assemblies.
