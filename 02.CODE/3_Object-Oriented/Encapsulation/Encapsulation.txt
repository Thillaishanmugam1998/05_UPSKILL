Encapsulation Principles
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. It involves bundling data (fields) and 
methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to some of the object's 
components.
This is achieved through access modifiers and well-designed public interfaces.
The key benefits of encapsulation include data hiding, improved maintainability, better code organization, 
and the ability to control how data is accessed and modified. Properties provide a clean way to implement encapsulation by 
allowing controlled access to private fields.
