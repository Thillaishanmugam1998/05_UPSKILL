Static Members and Static Classes
Static members belong to the type itself rather than to any specific instance. 
They are shared across all instances of the class and can be accessed without creating an object. 
Static classes cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members.
Static members are useful for utility functions, constants, and shared data that doesn't depend on instance state. 
They're loaded when the type is first referenced and remain in memory for the lifetime of the application.
