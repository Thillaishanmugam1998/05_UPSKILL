Namespaces and Using Statements
Namespaces provide a way to organize code and avoid naming conflicts by grouping related classes, interfaces, and other types. 
They create a hierarchical structure that helps manage large codebases. Using statements allow you to reference types 
from other namespaces without fully qualifying their names.
Namespaces are essential for creating maintainable applications, especially when working with multiple libraries or 
large projects where naming conflicts might occur.
