Here's a comprehensive roadmap from very basic to advanced C# concepts:
**Foundation Level (Very Basic)**
* Variables and data types (int, string, bool, double, etc.)
* Basic operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
* Console input/output (Console.WriteLine, Console.ReadLine)
* Comments and code documentation
* Basic string operations
* Type conversion and casting
* Constants and literals
**Basic Programming Constructs**
* Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
* Loops (for, while, do-while, foreach)
* Arrays (single-dimensional, multi-dimensional)
* Methods and functions
* Method parameters (value, reference, out, params)
* Method overloading
* Scope and lifetime of variables
**Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals**
* Classes and objects
* Fields, properties, and methods
* Constructors and destructors
* Access modifiers (private, public, protected, internal)
* Static members and static classes
* Namespaces and using statements
* Encapsulation principles
**Intermediate OOP Concepts**
* Inheritance and base classes
* Method overriding (virtual, override)
* Abstract classes and abstract methods
* Interfaces and interface implementation
* Polymorphism
* Sealed classes and methods
* Partial classes and methods
**Collections and Generics**
* Generic collections (List, Dictionary, Queue, Stack)
* Non-generic collections (ArrayList, Hashtable)
* Collection interfaces (IEnumerable, ICollection, IList)
* Custom generic classes and methods
* Generic constraints
* Iterators and yield keyword
**Exception Handling**
* Try-catch-finally blocks
* Exception types and hierarchy
* Custom exceptions
* Exception handling best practices
* Using statement and IDisposable
**Advanced Language Features**
* Delegates and events

* Extension methods
* Nullable types and null-coalescing operators
* Operator overloading
* Indexers
* Properties (auto-implemented, computed)
**LINQ and Functional Programming**
* LINQ to Objects
* LINQ syntax (method syntax vs query syntax)
* Standard query operators
* Anonymous types
* Expression trees
* Func and Action delegates
* Functional programming concepts
**Asynchronous Programming**
* async and await keywords
* Task and Task

* Memory management and garbage collection
* Weak references
* Finalization and IDisposable pattern
**Modern C# Features**
* Pattern matching
* Records and record types

* Top-level programs
**Threading and Concurrency**
* Thread class and ThreadStart
* Thread synchronization (lock, Monitor, Mutex)
* ThreadPool and background threads
* Concurrent collections
* Producer-consumer patterns
* Thread-safe programming
* Volatile keyword
**Advanced Framework Topics**
* Custom collection classes
* IEnumerable and IEnumerator implementation
* Serialization (JSON, XML, Binary)
* File I/O and streams
* Regular expressions
* Configuration and app settings
* Logging frameworks integration
**Performance and Optimization**
* Memory profiling and optimization
